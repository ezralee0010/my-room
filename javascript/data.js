      'Deep in the lower drawer of my cabinet is a collection of random scraps. Some yellowing with age. And some wrinkling under the pressure of those above. I like to think that they’re happily rotting in my drawer. But that is likely not the case. These scraps are arbitrary collections of items I have collected while traveling. Maps, brochures, movie tickets, museum admissions passes. Wherever I go, I just have to take something physical. Something that would remind me that I was physically present there. <br><br> But it\’s always haunted me that these scraps are just sitting there as newer, fresher pieces of paper pile above them. They all deserve to be spotlighted. Well, that\’s my belief. I recently bought a journal to start journaling. The technical term, I suppose, is junk journaling. Junk journaling consists of accumulating random materials to be pasted onto a journal. My precious scraps will be cut and sliced to shapes that will make them unrecognizable. But my hope is that they will find their new home better. <br><br> I started this journal with my recent study abroad trip to Paris alongside my weekend trips to Prague, Rome, Mainz, and some French cities. The following pages consist of select pictures of my junk journal.',

During the last day of high school, I watched this film with some friends. We skipped our classes and pulled it up on some illegal site on a friend’s phone. Funnily enough, the teacher I skipped class for actually passed by us while the movie was playing. Very awkward. But it was worth it. <br><br> Sorry, got a bit off track. <br><br> On the flip side, I love TV shows. Especially long ones. I love how I can just sit down and binge watch a series for a couple hours, leave it alone for some time, and then come back as if I never stopped. The story and world seem to never end. Until it does. And then I get sad. So I actually tend to avoid watching the series finale. Just so I don\’t have to say goodbye. It\’s a horrible habit of mine. <br><br> I\’ll show a few I’ve watched recently.'

A breeze slowly drifts through the windows. <br<br> This is the earliest childhood memory I have. <br><br> The view out in the window has always been what I notice most. In Paris, it was the garden view; in Chicago, the cars breezed through the Midway; in Seoul, the workers returned from a drink. <br><br> I love windows.'
